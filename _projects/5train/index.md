title: Boilermaker Special Replica 
In process of developing a detailed CAD assembly replicating Purdueâ€™s iconic Boilermaker Special train. The project involves modeling individual components with attention to geometric accuracy, structural details, and realistic part interactions. The assembly focuses on parametric design, use of mates and constraints, and organization of a complex multi-part system. Future work includes incorporating functional wheels, drivetrain elements, and electronic components to simulate real train mechanisms, with the goal of enhancing both mechanical realism and potential prototyping capability
