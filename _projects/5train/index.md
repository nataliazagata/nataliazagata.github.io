title: 3D Printed Train Alarm Clock
description: Designed and fabricated a custom alarm clock housed in a 3D-printed shell modeled in the shape of a truck. The enclosure was created using CAD software, optimized for printability, and fabricated with FDM 3D printing techniques. Integrated a soldered electronic clock kit inside the housing, ensuring proper alignment of components, secure mounting, and accessibility of controls. This project combined digital design, additive manufacturing, and hands-on electronics assembly.
