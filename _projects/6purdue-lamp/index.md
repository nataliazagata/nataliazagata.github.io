title: Purdue "P" Lamp
description: Designed and fabricated two custom lamps in the shape of the Purdue University logo, integrating LED light strips to create an illuminated display. The enclosure was modeled in Fusion 360 and optimized for strength, light diffusion, and cable management before being fabricated using FDM 3D printing. LED strips were measured, cut, and installed within the housing, with attention to electrical connections. This project combined additive manufacturing, electronics integration, and creative design to produce two functional decorative lamps with a clean, professional finish.
