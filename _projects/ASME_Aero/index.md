title: Fully 3D-Printed Airplane 
description: This two-part project aimed to create a fully 3D-printed, functional airplane. In the first phase, I printed and assembled pre-prepared airframe files, modifying electronics and structural components to accommodate resource constraints (see video below). In the second phase, I collaborated with ASME Aero to design fully custom wings with integrated ailerons in Fusion 360, ensuring proper fit and aerodynamic performance in coordination with teammate-designed tail and fuselage components.

## Future Work
Planned improvements include refining wing geometry for increased lift-to-drag efficiency, integrating lighter structural materials to improve flight time, and developing a fully custom fuselage to replace pre-prepared components. Additional goals include optimizing control surface responsiveness and conducting full-scale flight testing
