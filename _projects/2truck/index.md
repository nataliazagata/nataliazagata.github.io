title: 3D-Printed Truck Alarm Clock
description: A custom alarm clock enclosure modeled after a semi-truck using parametric CAD in Fusion 360. Assembled and soldered the digital clock module from an electronics kit, then designed the housing to accommodate the completed PCB, including precise internal mounting features, cable routing channels, and control access points. Utilized FDM 3D printing with PLA filament, optimizing slicer settings for dimensional accuracy and minimal post-processing. Applied multi-stage finishing techniques, including sanding, priming, and precision masking, to achieve a two-tone paint scheme. Integrated mechanical fasteners and adhesive bonding for structural integrity, resulting in a fully functional timekeeping device.
