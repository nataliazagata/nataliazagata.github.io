title: Pathways to Physical Sciences\: Capstone
description: Worked in a multidisciplinary team within a national lab environment to investigate the effect of pH on peptideâ€“heme binding using automated laboratory systems. Applied engineering principles and gained proficiency in microscopy, UV-Vis spectrometry, doctor blade coating, and OpenTron robot programming. Delivered a technical capstone report integrating experimental results with collaborative research insights.
